## Description
In this project, I created a Pokedex website using the PokeApi. The website allows users to:

👾 View a full Pokedex <br/>
👾 Search for specific Pokémon <br/>
👾 Filter by Pokémon type or name <br/>
👾 Clear filters to return to the full list <br/>

The goal was to learn how to interact with an external API and understand how to manipulate and display data dynamically. The visual design was inspired by Pokémon Legends: Arceus, using its color scheme, fonts, and overall aesthetic for the website's look and feel.

## Usage
#### Current Features:
🕹️ Search Pokémon by name or type<br/>
🕹️ Filter Pokémon by their types<br/>
🕹️ Responsive design improvements underway<br/>
🕹️ View Abilities, evolution chains and hear the pokemons voice <br/>
#### Planned Features:
🕹️ Add Pronouniations for the pokemon names<br/>
🕹️ Enhance responsiveness for mobile devices<br/>

## Features
💻 External API Integration: Fetches data from PokeApi to display Pokémon information dynamically.<br/>
💻 Search & Filter: Users can search by name or filter by type to narrow down their results.<br/>

## Tech Stack
🫀 JavaScript (for dynamic functionality)<br/>
🫀 React (for building the UI)<br/>
🫀 React Router (for page routing)<br/>
🫀 Vite (for fast builds and development)<br/>
🫀 PokeApi (for fetching Pokémon data)<br/>
🫀 HTML5 & CSS3 (for structure and styling)<br/>
🫀 Visual Studio Code (as the code editor)<br/>

Disclaimer: I am currently working on this project to improve the design and functionailty using new skills have learnt. At this moment i am working on adding new information about individual pokemon aswell as improving the responsivness.
